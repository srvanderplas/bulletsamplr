	abstract = {Recent advances in microscopy have made it possible to collect 3D topographic data, enabling more precise virtual comparisons based on the collected 3D data as a supplement to traditional comparison microscopy and 2D photography. Automatic comparison algorithms have been introduced for various scenarios, such as matching cartridge cases [1], [2] or matching bullet striae [3], [4], [5]. One key aspect of validating these automatic comparison algorithms is to evaluate the performance of the algorithm on external tests, that is, using data which were not used to train the algorithm. Here, we present a discussion of the performance of the matching algorithm [6] in three studies conducted using different Ruger weapons. We consider the performance of three scoring measures: random forest score, cross correlation, and consecutive matching striae (CMS) at the land-to-land level and, using Sequential Average Maxima scores, also at the bullet-to bullet level. Cross correlation and random forest scores both result in perfect discrimination of same-source and different-source bullets. At the land-to-land level, discrimination for both cross correlation and random forest scores (based on area under the curve, AUC) is excellent (≥ 0.90).},

The calculation of slopes is relatively challenging compared to the zero-crossing point detection. In order to calculate slopes, we need to firstly detect all the peak and valley values along the whole signal. The peak point is defined as local maxima and the valley point is defined as local minima. It is so obvious for human to detect peaks and valleys, but it is a challenging task for a computer.}
