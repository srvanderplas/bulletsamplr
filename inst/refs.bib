	abstract = {The forensic science community has increasingly sought quantitative methods for conveying the weight of evidence. Experts from many forensic laboratories summarize their fndings in terms of a likelihood ratio. Several proponents of this approach have argued that Bayesian reasoning proves it to be normative. We fnd this likelihood ratio paradigm to be unsupported by arguments of Bayesian decision theory, which applies only to personal decision making and not to the transfer of information from an expert to a separate decision maker. We further argue that decision theory does not exempt the presentation of a likelihood ratio from uncertainty characterization, which is required to assess the ftness for purpose of any transferred quantity. We propose the concept of a lattice of assumptions leading to an uncertainty pyramid as a framework for assessing the uncertainty in an evaluation of a likelihood ratio. We demonstrate the use of these concepts with illustrative examples regarding the refractive index of glass and automated comparison scores for fngerprints.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05788},
	abstract = {In 2009, the National Academy of Sciences published a report questioning the scientific validity of many forensic methods including firearm examination. Firearm examination is a forensic tool used to help the court determine whether two bullets were fired from the same gun barrel. During the firing process, rifling, manufacturing defects, and impurities in the barrel create striation marks on the bullet. Identifying these striation markings in an attempt to match two bullets is one of the primary goals of firearm examination. We propose an automated framework for the analysis of the 3D surface measurements of bullet land impressions which transcribes the individual characteristics into a set of features that quantify their similarities. This makes identification of matches easier and allows for a quantification of both matches and matchability of barrels. The automatic matching routine we propose manages to (a) correctly identify land impressions (the surface between two bullet groove impressions) with too much damage to be suitable for comparison, and (b) correctly identify all 10,384 land-to-land matches of the James Hamby study.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new method to generate synthetic executions of on-line words from real samples. The proposed generation method takes advantage of the characteristics of a writer recognition system developed by the authors and can be seamlessly integrated into it. Both the generation method and the recognition system consider strokes as the structural units of handwriting with words being regarded as two sequences, one of pen-up and one of pen-down strokes. Given two samples from the same word and writer, a new sample is produced by aligning their sequences of strokes and then averaging the matching pairs. Thanks to a self-organising map used to categorise strokes, the alignment and comparison of sequences of strokes are performed in a straightforward and computationally efﬁcient way.},

This paper describes a novel technique for the automatic synthesis of human handwritten-signature images, which introduces modeled variability within the generated output based on positional variation that is naturally found within genuine source data. The synthesized data were found to generate similar verification rates to those obtained using genuine data with the use of a commercial verification engine, thereby indicating the suitability of the data synthesized by using this method for a wide range of application scenarios.},

Though this progress is at least partially due to ballooning training set sizes – huge numbers of face images downloaded and labeled for identity – it is not clear if the formidable task of collecting so many images is truly necessary. We propose a far more accessible means of increasing training data sizes for face recognition systems: Domain speciﬁc data augmentation. We describe novel methods of enriching an existing dataset with important facial appearance variations by manipulating the faces it contains. This synthesis is also used when matching query images represented by standard convolutional neural networks. The eﬀect of training and testing with synthesized images is tested on the LFW and IJB-A (veriﬁcation and identiﬁcation) benchmarks and Janus CS2. The performances obtained by our approach match state of the art results reported by systems trained on millions of downloaded images.},
