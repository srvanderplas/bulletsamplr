# Introduction

## Null Distributions in Forensic Statistics

## Threshold Bootstrap

Misappropriated from time-series statistics; important because it maintains continuity and should be relatively differentiable (in practice)

## Description of Hamby studies

# Threshold bootstrap and bullet signatures

## Consecutive Matching Striae and resampling

## Theoretical probability of signature overlap due to same-piece resampling

## Computational assessment

# Case study: Resampling Hamby bullet signatures



# Conclusion
